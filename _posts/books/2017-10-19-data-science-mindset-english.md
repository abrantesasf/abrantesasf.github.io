One of the books I'm reading right now is _Zacharias Voulgaris's_ **Data Science: Mindset, Methodologies, and Misconceptions**, the first edition of which was published in 2017.

I'm liking this book because the author has been able to write a completely different text from the other data science books I have read, completely avoiding technicities, mathematics, statistics, machine learning and complex analyzes to provide a broad and general view of the "ecosystem" of data science.

Imagine you are flying over the entire data science "ecosystem", 10 km height: you will have an **overview of everything**, you will be able to differentiate between data science, business intelligence and statistics, you will see the data science "process" (from asking the right question, to data engineering, modeling and visualization), you'll see which analytical methods and algorithms are available, see the entire data scientist toolbox, see how each "component" of the ecosystem relates to the others, the most common errors and some other aspects (such as artificial intelligence and ethics).

Since the author's proposal was to provide an overview to clarify all the "components" of the data science "ecosystem," do not look in this book for detailed, technical, and operational information on _how to execute_ what is being learned. There is no mathematical formula, no description of the guts of machine learning algorithms, no statistical model, no R or Python code demonstrating any of the techniques and theories explained by the author. You will learn _what tools exist and when they should be used_, but you will not learn how to use these tools.

If your goal is to learn _how to use_ certain data science tools, this book is not for you. But if you try to understand a little more about the field of data science in a very general way (and this is not to say superficial), then **Data Science: Mindset, Methodologies, and Misconceptions** is an interesting option for your library.

To buy the book (and help me with a few cents that Amazon will pay me if the purchase is made through the links below), go to:
