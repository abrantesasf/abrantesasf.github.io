If you want to learn the basics of programming in R, a good interesting book is _Roger D. Peng's_ **R Programming for Data Science**:

This book is relatively small (182 pages) and presents an overview of R, from basic information about what R is to even more advanced topics about how to program in the R language (after all, that's the purpose of the book).


The title of the book is a bit misleading: it is _not specific to data science_. In fact it is an introduction to R programming that can serve anything (data science, statistics, math, financial analysis, etc.). So do not expect to find any magic recipe for programming algorithms or specific analyzes for Data Science because you will be frustrated. Understand this book more as a general learning about R programming, knowing that the teachings the book provides are general and can be applied in any field (including Data Science). No previous experience is required in R, but if you already know some aspects of programming, learning will be easier.

The cost/benefit: if you just want the book in PDF/EPUB/ MOBI, you can download it for free at [leanpub.com/rprogramming](https://leanpub.com/rprogramming) (the author suggests that you pay US$ 20.00, but this totally depends on you - if you want to pay, OK; if you do not want to, OK too).

There are also two other options for acquiring the book, which include some extra content. The options are as follows:
- _PDF/EPUB/MOBI_
  - Free,  or US$ 20.00 (suggested by the author)
- _PDF/EPUB/MOBI + Datasets + R files_
  - US$ 20.00 minimum, or US$ 25.00 (suggested by the author)
- _PDF/EPUB/MOBI + Datasets + R files + Lecture Videos_
  - US$ 30.00 minimum, or US$ 35.00 (suggested by the author)

I would like to cite 2 negative points:

1. Some more advanced subjects are treated very superficially (for example, code vectorizing; note that this is not necessarily a defect since the purpose of the book is to present programming in R in general)
2. Some subjects are only available in video lectures (for example, the R installation)

Anyway, [**R Programming for Data Science**](https://leanpub.com/rprogramming) is an interesting book for anyone who is beginning to learn the R language and wants to know the basics of programming. And, since PDf is free, you can start your study without spending anything; but I emphatically suggest you pay the author (so he can keep writing!).
