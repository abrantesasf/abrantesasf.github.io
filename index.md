Welcome to my personal website! Here you will find reports of my professional experiences, texts and documents on subjects of my interest (mainly data science, analytics, big data, statistics, epidemiology, various topics regarding computer science and other things).

Please note: I am Brazilian and many materials are in Portuguese. I am working to translate them into English as soon as possible. I will clearly indicate the language of some text or document so that you can decide whether it is worthwhile or not to click on any link.

I accept (and desire) criticisms and suggestions, especially if you find something inaccurate or wrong. Please see the contact page to learn how to talk to me.

Thank you!
