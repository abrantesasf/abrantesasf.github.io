Who is Abrantes Filho?

Well, my formal education says that I am a medical doctor with a master's degree in epidemiology
(specifically in the area of research and statistical analysis of data).

However, when you start to get to know me, you will see that I have always directed my activities
to the Information Technology (IT) field and, since about 2002, I have been working as IT Manager
and as IT Director (CIO) in large companies in the health care area.

I am also an active self-learning student whose goal is to read 5-6 books a month (seriously!),
and to do as many specialization courses as possible within my areas of interest and interest
(data science, analytics, big data, epidemiology).

I can navigate exceptionally well between operational and management departments, and I can
transform the demands and desires of managers (always somewhat abstract and generic) into
concrete and specific solutions for the most diverse areas and business needs. For this I use
technologies from the simplest (such as a spreadsheet) to the most sophisticated ones
(such as large database systems integrated with real-time information analysis,
BI systems, Data Analytics and, more recently, Big Data and Data Science).

At the moment I am specializing as Data Scientist, to merge my knowledge of research,
statistics and data analysis with the most powerful tools of IT to transform data into
solutions and actions so that companies can innovate and stay ahead of competitors.

In addition I have advanced knowledge and expertise in large number of IT tools, such as:
Databases (Oracle, PostgreSQL, MySQL, SQL Server); Linux/Unix Administration (RedHat,
CentOS, SuSE, Debian); Statistical and Mathematical Software (R, Stata, SPSS, Matlab,
Octave); and several other Miscellaneous Systems (general and specialized).
