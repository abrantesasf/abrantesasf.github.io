## Phone number

Email is my primary (and prefered) means of communication. I do use the phone for emergencies or to talk to customers
and consulting clients. If you want me to call you, please send me an email with your number, the topic of conversation,
and a good time to call. You can reach me at:

- For **NORMAL** day to day work, please use my mobile phone: +55 (27) 9-9891-4393
- For **EMERGENCIES** only, you can also use my home phone: +55 (27) 3299-0575

Please note: english is not my primary language (it is brazilian portuguese). I do speak english, but sometimes you
will have to speak a little more slowly than usual. ;^)
